# 📐 Experience & Projects

## AI & Data Projects

  * **Masters project - graphically editable music transformations**
      * Implemented advanced signal processing and ML compatible mathematical transforms (NSGT) to demonstrate a novel music editing workflow.
      * Working with tensor computation in pytorch for signal processing.
  * **High performance metaheuristic algorithms using TensorFlow**
      * Used TensorFlow to implement metaheuristic algorithms (particle swarm optimiser, genetic algorithm) leveraging CUDA.
  * **[Edinburgh cycle share scheme](https://redd.it/mrbvvt) - data analysis and presentation**
      * Analysed and visualised public sector transport data using Python and data science packages, providing actionable insights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  * **Inkwell PR - GPT based press release generator**
      * Contributed to the development of a GPT based press release generator, refining the core service and integrating payment/subscription.
  * **SendEvent app - NLP assisted events and invitations**
      * Used NLP tools to turn plain English phrases into structured, shareable iCal files.
      * Experimented with finetuning LLaMa, Qwen and Gemini models to perform advanced phrase NLU: "every second friday of june"

## Web & Software Projects

  * **[Binary Abacus](https://tommo.page/abacus) - Interactive binary learning tool for kids** 
      * Built a modern, interactive web application using React to help users learn about binary numbers, encoding systems, and bitwise operations.
      * Implemented features including multiple rows for simultaneous values, configurable bit columns, and various encoding options (unsigned/signed binary, IEEE 754, ASCII).
      * Created an intuitive UI with visual beads that change color based on position, keyboard shortcuts, and sound feedback.
      * Designed with responsive layout and multiple interaction modes (keyboard/mouse) for accessibility.
  * **[Workout Mate](https://workout.tommo.page) - Gymnastics strength and conditioning app** 
      * Developed a web app for the Edinburgh University Gymnastics club's strength and conditioning programme, using React, Astro, and GitHub Actions.
      * Collaborated with club members to refine the app and deliver a user-focused solution.

## Hardware & Embedded Projects

  * **Tenuto; Robot piano tutor** 
      * Developed hardware and control software for a robotic piano tutor concept, interfacing with Bluetooth LE MIDI and utilising wireless chips, microcontrollers, and MOSFETs to drive a solenoid array, with variable key velocity using high-frequency control signals.
      * Key player in a large team; product demo rated best among 23 teams by technology and business experts.
  * **Wireless measurement device for understanding impact forces on gymnasts** 
      * Created a wearable harness with inertial measurement hardware, collected data over Bluetooth using Python.
      * Performed analysis and visualisation to gain insights into physical preparation.
