    Able to consider the broader impact of your design and coding decisions and those of others 

    Great at breaking down big tasks into small chunks, solving tricky problems and tackling risks

Working Details 

This is a full-time role (37.5 hours per week). We typically work from 09:00 - 17:30 from Monday to Friday, though we can be flexible around this, just let us know. 

We’re ideally looking for someone in/around Edinburgh, though we’re open to the possibility of this being a remote role (as long as you're in the UK). We're making the most of hybrid working, so you won't need to come into the office everyday (unless you want to!). 

We don't mandate required office days, but we find that most of the team enjoy working from the office 2-3 days a week to connect with their team and other Dayshapers and to make use of space, and for meetings and collaboration.  

Join the team! 

Equality of opportunity is more than just a responsibility: we believe it’s a huge advantage to welcome a variety of experiences and perspectives into the team. Diversity is a great asset and, as such, we strongly encourage applications from any background. 

This is your opportunity to really influence how we get things done, and how our product develops to meet our customer’s needs. We're doing well, but there's lots more to do in order to maintain the high bar and pace that we've set. 

If your experience isn't an exact match for this job description, but you have transferrable skills/experience that you think would be a great fit, please outline this in a cover letter. Everyone here is growing personally as the company grows, so if that sounds like something you’d like to be part of, we’d love to see your application.  The deadline for applications is Monday 22nd December at 12pm.

*Please note the successful candidate for this role will be subject to background checks and will have an opportunity to declare anything to us beforehand*
