Dear Andy,

I’m a developer recently graduated with a Master’s in Informatics from the University of Edinburgh. During my studies I worked with three startups, two of them at a very early stage, and as an intern at PlayerData. I’m applying for the Product Engineer role because Wordsmith is tackling exactly the kind of problem I enjoy, turning complex and sensitive work into scalable AI-native UX.

I’ve worked on 2 novel AI SaaS products, QuickWord and Inkwell PR, as both frontend and full-stack engineer, building workflows designed from the ground up around AI models. I’m comfortable with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind. I care deeply about UX, while also having the technical foundation to think in terms of systems - performance, security, and long-term maintenance.

Alongside product engineering, I have a strong ML background. I’ve worked with applied ML and NLP systems and recently completed a maths-heavy Master’s project using PyTorch, where I demonstrated a music-editing workflow based on cutting-edge signal processing research. I’m comfortable treating LLMs not just as API calls, but as system components that require careful design, iteration, and integration.

What excites me about Wordsmith is the combination of product ambition, technical depth, and the opportunity to help define the future of legal work.

I’m used to handling the uncertainty of building products that don’t yet exist. I aim to write minimal, effective code and introduce abstraction only where it's deserved. I enjoy working with teams that value this way of building.

I’d love to talk about this role or another future role at Wordsmith as you continue to grow your product and engineering team.

Best regards,
Thomas Chung
