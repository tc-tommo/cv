Wordsmith

Most legal teams are drowning. They’re buried under internal questions, contract reviews, policy approvals, and fire drills from every corner of the business.

Wordsmith is the AI command center for in-house legal. We automate the chaos—intake, Q&A, redlines, drafting, and research—so legal can finally operate at the speed of business.

Backed by Index Ventures and some of the sharpest minds in law and AI, we’re scaling fast across London, New York, and beyond. Our customers include fast-growth tech companies and public enterprises. We’re building the future of legal work.

The Role

Design and deliver world-class product experiences that harness the power of LLMs and redefine how legal teams work. You’ll build core features, influence architectural decisions, and collaborate closely with cross-functional teammates to ship fast, iterate, and make an impact.

Key Responsibilities:

    Own end-to-end product features across frontend and backend

    Collaborate with design, product, and legal engineering to deliver polished, AI-native workflows

    Help architect and evolve our codebase for performance, scale, and developer experience

    Contribute to shaping engineering practices, tooling, and team culture

Experience & Qualifications:

    4+ years of experience building high-impact web products

    Strong knowledge of core technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript; backend experience (e.g. Python, Node.js, AWS) is a bonus

    Deep product instincts—you care about clean UI, intuitive UX, and building for user outcomes

    Practical understanding of security, scalability, and technical debt in fast-moving environments

    Interest in AI/LLMs and building AI-native user experiences

What you can expect

    A high-trust environment with meaningful ownership over what you build

    Real-world product challenges—security, performance, usability—at the heart of legal workflows

    A tight-knit team of engineers, designers, legal minds, and builders

    Competitive salary, meaningful equity, and the opportunity to shape an early product and team

Who You Are: You might have built at an early-stage startup or scaled features at a high-growth company. You’re fluent in full-stack thinking, but even more fluent in user empathy. You’re excited by the pace and ambiguity of a company still forming its best practices—and you love helping define them.

Bonus: Experience working on internal legal tools, legal ops software, or compliance platforms. Curiosity around prompt engineering, user intent modeling, or AI reasoning is also a plus.

If you’re looking for more than just a job - a place to learn, grow, and have a real impact from day one - this could be the one. We’re building something exciting, and we’re looking for people who want to be part of the journey. If that sounds like you, hit apply.

I was having a look at this job and although it's a little bit more experience required than maybe I've got, I should at least give it a try.
