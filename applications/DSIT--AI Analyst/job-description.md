Job description

In January 2025, we published the AI Opportunities Action Plan that aims to build a UK sector that can scale and compete globally, boost technology adoption across the economy, and ensure the necessary infrastructure, talent, and data access to drive AI adoption in both the public and private sectors. The Plan included 50 actions in total focused on UK AI Capabilities, AI adoption, and Sovereign AI, which we are responsible for delivering as a whole.  

The AI Opportunities Analysis team sits within the AI Opportunities directorate and is led by the AI Analysis Deputy Director. The Analysis Team consists of a range of analytical professions and our purpose is to ensure that evidence is at the heart of policy. We do this by producing influential analysis to shape and challenge decision making.

As an Analyst in our team, you will support the delivery of the AI Opportunities Action Plan. Your work will involve using analysis and evidence to inform policymaking and maximise AI's potential impacts. It is a fast-paced and exciting environment, especially given the rapid developments in AI models. As such, the role requires someone who can be adaptable and innovative in applying analytical techniques to a nascent and ever-changing policy area.  

About the Role 

We are looking for two experienced analysts to help shape the delivery of the Action Plan. The first will look at how we can build UK Sovereign AI capabilities, including in scientific discovery. This includes fostering high-value research, attracting top AI talent, and supporting the growth of the UK AI ecosystem. The second is about understanding and modelling the adoption of AI and the socioeconomic impacts of using AI, particularly on the labour market. For example, developing policies that equip firms and people with the skills and knowledge to use AI, and analysing the potential transformative effects on the labour market.

Some of the key analytical questions we currently have include:

- Which AI firms show the most promise of driving growth in the UK AI sector?

- What are the next big scientific areas of interest in AI development, and how can we support further research and development in these areas?

- How important is data to AI development, considering trends like the use of synthetic data?

- What is the level of AI adoption across the economy?

- How can firms be supported to adopt AI?

- What is the economic and societal impact of using AI? For example, exploring the productivity uplift, creation of new markets, and public attitudes.

- Which roles and sectors will be most impacted by AI?

Your role will involve planning, delivering and disseminating analysis to answer these questions. We actively encourage taking different approaches, such as social research, data science of large datasets, applying economic theory, and developing impactful data visualisations. The team has a range of skills and experiences that you will be able to learn from. You will also need to work closely with policy teams to understand their questions and ensure that your work has impact on influencing policy decisions.

Person specification

Key responsibilities

This includes, but not limited to:

- Scoping new analytical work-streams – from rapid reviews through to more in depth mixed methods research – to understand and articulate how best to deliver the AI Opportunities Action Plan. You will get to define new research questions from directly engaging with policy customers and stakeholders, weigh up the pros and cons of possible methods to decide on the most effective analytical approach, and manage projects from end-to-end. 

- Leading a data-driven approach to identify policy priorities. For example, identifying firms and market segments government should support, in terms of their firm characteristics, AI capabilities, and growth potential. This is expected to be a mix of applying data science techniques to our large datasets on the AI ecosystem, as well as horizon scanning techniques.

- Building the evidence to understand the impact of AI, by keeping abreast of the latest data and literature, as well as and model future scenarios. You will work across government to ensure robust and relevant data and insights are directly shaping policy development. You will also use data visualisations to best convey your evidence. 

- Developing and leading business cases and evaluations, which make the case for investment and understands ‘what works’. These will use tools such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA), scenario analysis, as well as experimental, quasi-experimental and mixed methods to illustrate / demonstrate the impact of the Action Plan. 

- Leading and coaching junior analysts, potentially including line management. You will help them contribute to our analytical projects; setting their work programme and ensuring they have suitable development opportunities.

- Communicating complex analytical findings in a way that is impactful and understood by a range of stakeholders of varying levels of seniority and backgrounds 

- Building and maintaining strong, trusted relationships with stakeholders both inside and outside of DSIT. For example, engaging with industry stakeholders to understand their business models or having a dialogue with firms across the economy to identify their barriers to adopting AI.

Essential criteria

- Applying strategic thinking, intellectual curiosity, and ability to make judgement on high profile complex policy issues.

- Understanding and communicating complex analysis and using innovative analytical techniques to influence policy decisions.  

- Collaborating with policy teams, stakeholders and experts to understand their needs and use evidence effectively, even during uncertainty. 

- Experience in using research and analysis to directly shape decisions and working flexibly to provide support to cross-cutting AI policy questions.

The role is reserved for badged Government analytical professions: Government Statistician Group (GSG), Government Economic Service (GES), Government Social Research Service (GSR), Government Operational Research Service (GORS). Candidates who are not members must be eligible and willing to take the tests to become a member. Those wishing to apply to either the Government Statistician Group will need to sit online tests as part of the application process.

Desirable criteria

A background in AI policy or technology is not essential, but demonstrating a strong interest in the area is desirable. The fast-paced nature of AI developments means being adaptable and innovative in applying analytical techniques to a nascent and ever-changing policy area.  

Offered benefits

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology offers a competitive mix of benefits including:

    A culture of flexible working, such as job sharing, homeworking and compressed hours.
