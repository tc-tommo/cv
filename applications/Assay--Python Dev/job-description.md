### About the Role

We’re looking for a junior Python developer to join our small team and help improve and expand a large, custom-built ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system — the software that runs our business operations.

The system is mature and works well, but parts of it are old and need upgrading. You’ll be writing new features, fixing issues, and gradually modernising parts of the code with support from our business analyst and consulting developer.

On completion of the modernisation of the core system logic, as a team, we will embark on the development of some exciting new features. This role aims to develop the right candidate for a lead developer role.

This is a great role if you want to understand how real-world systems evolve, and if you’re ready to learn by doing.

---

### What You’ll Do

- Read and work within a real production codebase
- Build new features to support business needs
- Debug and refactor legacy code
- Learn how large systems are maintained over time
- Collaborate with our systems analyst to understand business logic

---

### Who This is For

We’re not expecting tons of experience. If you’re graduating soon or recently finished a bootcamp, this could be a great next step.

You might be a great fit if you:
- Enjoy solving real problems (not just building from scratch)
- Like to move quickly without too many meetings
- Are curious about how complex systems work
- Don’t mind reading “older” code to figure things out
- Want to get better at writing clean, maintainable code
- Are patient, detail-oriented, and open to feedback
