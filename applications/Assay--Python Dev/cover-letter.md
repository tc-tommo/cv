Dear Hiring Manager,

In my family, service is a strong value. My father and mother have been practising NHS doctors for over 30 years, and my grandparents were civil servants who worked on detecting atmospheric signatures of the atom bomb. From this I understand the importance of trusted, stable institutions which look out for the interests of people.

I have a strong background in Python development, and I have experience with modernising mathematical code for signal processing, allowing it to be interoperable with machine learning models. I value clean, efficient code having worked on embedded systems. I have also gained experience building back end and frontend applications with local startups. I have been the chief system architect in my university robotics project team of ten students.
I try to offer balanced, informed opinions on new technology. I'm patient, I actively seek feedback, and I make sure to honestly communicate. I don't always have the answer, but I get there quickly.

As a graduate of Edinburgh University, I have a reverence for the city and it's history. I would be excited to contribute to the Assay Office's longevity through helping you develop modern, efficient enterprise systems that meet your needs for the future.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Thomas Chung
