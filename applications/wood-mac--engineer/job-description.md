Job Description 
We are looking for a Data Engineer who can leverage Python to build new data pipelines.  

 

Your role will sit within an Agile team developing backend data pipelines and processes, aligned to our data roadmap for delivering new features for Wood Mackenzie’s flagship product offering, Lens.  

 

You will work alongside other Data Engineers, business SMEs, product and data owners to ensure Wood Mackenzie delivers a world-class experience for its customers - helping them change the way we power our planet. 

 

Main Responsibilities 
As part of a team of Data Engineers, you’ll take full responsibility for writing, testing, and delivering robust pipelines and processes that feed data into Wood Mackenzie’s Lens Platform. Using established patterns with Python, AWS, and a bespoke Data Platform, you’ll be supported to deliver discrete pieces of work ranging from a few days to a few weeks. 

 

We are particularly interested in candidates who bring experience or a strong interest in leveraging AI tools such as code generation, anomaly detection, or intelligent automation - to improve the efficiency, quality, and scalability of data pipelines and development workflows. 

 

Once established in the role, we expect you to make incremental improvements to our patterns and processes. We’re looking for someone who has informed opinions on technologies, frameworks, and approaches to delivery. You must be able to articulate ideas effectively and strive to constantly improve deliverables. 

 

Essential 

    Demonstrable depth of knowledge working with Python 
    Experience working with data, e.g. Pandas, SQL 
    A proactive approach to continuous learning and improvement, including the use of AI tools to support development tasks 
    Mentoring from experienced colleagues and access to training courses will help you attain a high level of skill, especially if your background is in other programming languages 
    We actively encourage and support obtaining formal certification such as those offered by AWS 

 

Desirable 

    Experience with or a strong interest in applying AI/ML tools to enhance data engineering workflows (e.g. automated testing, code optimization, data quality monitoring, or intelligent alerting) 
    Some R experience, and a willingness to help support a legacy R Shiny application is an advantage but not necessary 
    Familiarity with tools such as GitHub Copilot, AWS AI services, or open-source LLMs for development support 

 

Mentoring from experienced colleagues and access to training courses will help you attain a high level of skill, especially for those who primarily have experience in other programming languages. 

 

It’s essential that you’re able to take on the challenge of continuous learning and improvement. We actively encourage and support obtaining formal certification such as those offered by AWS. 

 

Expectations 

    You’ll work directly with stakeholders, often internationally, so it’s essential that you can form a good working relationship with them, understand what they want, and keep them up to date with progress 
    Excellent problem-solving and analysis skills coupled with great communication skills and strong attention to detail 
    Commitment to excellence and meeting the high-quality standards expected by our clients 
    Experience in working in different delivery methodologies and an understanding of their benefits/constraints 
    We are a hybrid working company and the successful applicant will be expected to be physically present in the Edinburgh office at least 2 days per week to foster and contribute to a collaborative environment, though this may be subject to change in the future 
    Due to the global nature of the team, a degree of flexible working will be required to accommodate different time zones 

 

Leadership 

    Contribute to a culture of product development where solving problems for our customers is the highest priority 
    Communicate effectively across functions as required 

 

Collaboration 

    Work in collaboration with team members to perform scoping, estimation, and technology feasibility tasks for the intended solution 
    Manage dependencies among engineering activities and constantly monitor, assess, and control the technical execution 
    Address technical queries and elicit, prioritise, and negotiate changes to requirements and defects 
    Contribute to system and data issue identification and resolution within teams across the organization
