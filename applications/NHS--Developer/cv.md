# Personal Statement

I am a computer science graduate with a passion for building things, I always try to reimagine how we interact with data and our devices.
My strongest talent is to produce creative, high quality ideas and designs. I struggle to feel this shining about my own abilities but I have been told I have been good at it. I also try to support that by building strong technical understanding from the atoms up.
My work is driven by the synthesis of high tech concepts into human centred design. I hope that my experience in academic and personal projects demonstrates an ability to be an autonomous operator, and producer of creative and actionable ideas.



# üìê Experience & Projects

## üéì University

### Masters project - music editing with spectrograms
* Demonstrated using advanced signal processing techniques to render an editable spectrogram of a song in an ordinary image format.
* Working with PyTorch for tensor operations.

### High performance metaheuristic algorithms using TensorFlow 
* Used TensorFlow to implement GPU accelerated particle swarm optimiser and genetic algorithms.

### [Edinburgh cycle share scheme](https://redd.it/mrbvvt) - data analysis and presentation 
* Analysed data from Edinburgh's cycle rental scheme during COVID-19 using Python data science packages

### [Binary Abacus](https://tommo.page/abacus) - Interactive binary learning tool for learners
* Built a modern, interactive web application using React to help learners interact with binary numbers in a more meaningful way.
* Implemented various encoding options and technical levels (unsigned/signed binary, IEEE 754, ASCII).
* Designed with responsive layout and multiple interaction modes (keyboard/mouse) for accessibility.

### [Workout Mate](https://workout.tommo.page) - Gymnastics strength and conditioning app 
* As part of a redesign project for the Hevy workout app, I developed a web app which now is used to provide the Edinburgh University Gymnastics club's strength and conditioning programme.
* Used React, Astro and Github Actions to create a web app to help the club members perform \\ workouts.

### Tenuto; Robot piano tutor 
* Developed hardware and control software for a robotic piano tutor concept, interfacing with Bluetooth LE MIDI and utilising wireless chips, microcontrollers, and high-power transistors to drive a solenoid array, with variable key velocity using PWM signalling.
* Key player in a large team; product demo rated best among 23 teams by technology and business experts.
* I was a key contributor of product design and development.

## üéÆ Hobby projects

### SendEvent app - NLP assisted events and invitations 
* Uses a natural language processing framework to turn plain English descriptions of events into shareable formats.

### Wireless measurement device for understanding impact forces on gymnasts 
* Created a wearable harness with inertial measurement hardware, collected data over Bluetooth using Python API.
* Analysis and visualisation to gain insights into physical preparation.

<!-- ### [Training clock](https://clock.tommo.page) for Edinburgh university gymnastics club 
* Built using React and deployed using Firebase.
* Used for my former role as social and fundraising coordinator for the club.
* Synchronised to a central calendar and displays upcoming social/competitive events. -->

## üè´ High school
