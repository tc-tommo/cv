# Personal Statement

I am a computer science graduate with a passion for building things, I always try to reimagine how we interact with data and our devices.
My strongest talent is to produce creative, high quality ideas and designs. I struggle to feel this shining about my own abilities but I have been told I have been good at it. I also try to support that by building strong technical understanding from the atoms up.
My work is driven by the synthesis of high tech concepts into human centred design. I hope that my experience in academic and personal projects demonstrates an ability to be an autonomous operator, and producer of creative and actionable ideas.
