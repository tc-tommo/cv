Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying to be one of your graduate transport planners. 
I am available to start in September 2026, at your Edinburgh office.
I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Informatics from the University of Edinburgh. In 2016, I formed an intense obsession with the simulation game Cities: Skylines, which started a lasting interest in the built environment. I very much considered studying a degree in planning at university. 
I chose to study computer science because it provided me with 2 things: a strong, versatile set of skills, and a way to remain flexible in an uncertain job market. Despite this, I really would like to get across how keen I am to pursue a career in planning. Rather than lacking fit, it's my hope you would see this background as an asset to your business.
In a second year coursework, I helped analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the cycle network in Edinburgh, showing a diffusion of activity for commuter trunk routes, and increased demand for leisure trips. Bringing the story to life through visualisation is one of the strengths I offered my team.

As someone who is coming from outside the field, I would be receptive to getting professional accreditation.

My interest for transport planning was formed by a video game, but it was nurtured from my engagement with real places, and a realisation that there are better alternatives to car-dominated development. 
Influential 20th century planners like Colin Buchanan accepted an inevitability of car traffic, but have left us with a chequered legacy; elevated concrete carriageways have scarred the fabric of cities like Glasgow and Birmingham, leading fragmented and deprived urban communities, and polluted skies. At the same time, rural places have been connected to life saving services, motorways brought economic growth, access to nature, and greater individual freedom. I'd like to help define the 21st century approach to transportation, to help cities find a better balance to questions of autonomy, capacity, environment, and wellbeing.

What excites me about Arup is your expertise in transport modelling and simulation, which I understand is a core offering to your clients. When I was interning at PlayerData, I gained nuts and bolts experience with simulated environments, as I was given a largely autonomous role to produce an emulator of their wearable gadget. This enabled PlayerData to virtually test enhancements to their to product, without risk to physical hardware. While this is a little different to largescale multiagent simulation, I think I have foundations in parallel processing and HPC that would learning your MATsim tooling not take long. On matters of software engineering, I am certain I have the system level perspective to help keep you at the cutting edge.

I am competent in Excel and can write high quality technical reports. My master's project in music production technology achieved a 78% report grade. This was in part because I successfully demonstrated something previously only possible with commercial software, but also because it required the integration of cutting edge mathematical research.

I hope I've convinced you that I am enthusiastic and capable for this role.
Happy new year, and thank you for considering me.
