Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying to be one of your graduate transport planners. 
I am available to start in September 2026, at your Edinburgh office.
I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Informatics from the University of Edinburgh. In 2016, I formed an intense obsession with the simulation game Cities: Skylines, which started a lasting interest in the built environment. I very much considered studying a degree in planning at university. 
I chose to study computer science because it provided me with 2 things: a strong, versatile set of skills, and a way to remain flexible in an uncertain job market. Despite this, I really would like to get across how keen I am to pursue a career in planning. Rather than lacking fit, it's my hope you would see this background as an asset to your business.

As someone who is coming from outside the field, I would be receptive to getting professional accreditation.

My interest for transport planning was formed by a video game, but it was nurtured from my engagement with real places, and a realisation that there are better alternatives to the near century of car-dominated development we've lived under. 
20th century planning philosophy had a clear vision for an automotive utopia; it has left lasting scars on the fabric of cities like Glasgow and Birmingham, it fragmented and deprived urban communities, and polluted the skies. At the same time, it connected rural places to life saving services, brought economic growth, access to nature, and greater individual freedom. I'd like to help define the 21st century approach to transportation, to help cities find a better balance between autonomy, capacity, environment, and wellbeing.

I'd like to bring to your attention [this visualisation for a data science project](https://redd.it/mrbvvt), showing COVID-19's significant effect on the cycle network in Edinburgh, leading to a diffusion of activity for commuter trunk routes, and increased demand for leisure trips. Being able to use data to bring a story to life I believe is one of my strengths.

What excites me about Arup is your expertise in transport modelling and simulation, which I understand is a core offering to your clients. When I was interning at PlayerData, I gained nuts and bolts experience with creating digital twins, as I was given a largely autonomous role to produce an emulator of their wearable gadget. This enabled PlayerData to carry out tests of enhancements to their to product firmware, without risk to physical hardware. While this is a little different to largescale multiagent simulation, I think I have foundations in parallel processing and HPC that would make getting familiar with your MATsim tooling quite fast. I am certain I have perspectives from the systems level, that will help keep you at the cutting edge.

I am competent in Excel and can write high quality technical reports. My master's project in music production technology achieved a 78% report grade. This was in part because I successfully demonstrated something previously only possible with commercial software, but also because it required the integration of cutting edge mathematical research.

I hope I've convinced you that I am enthusiastic and capable for this role.
Happy new year, and thank you for considering me.
