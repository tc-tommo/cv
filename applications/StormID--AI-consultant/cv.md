# Personal Statement

I am a computer science graduate with a passion for building things.
My strongest talent is to produce inventive, high quality ideas and designs. I don't often feel this shining about my own abilities but I have consistent feedback that I am good at this. I also try to support that by building strong technical understanding of computers, language models, and software from the atoms up.
My work is driven by the synthesis of high tech concepts into applications for people. I hope that my experience in academic and personal projects gives some demonstration of my strength as an autonomous operator and creative person.


## Skills
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, LLM fine-tuning (LLaMa, Qwen, Phi), NLP frameworks, model evaluation, Application development using LLMs
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, data analysis, data visualisation, benchmark evaluation, public sector data
- **Front-End:** JavaScript, Node.js, React, UI/UX design
- **Programming:** Python, TypeScript, Haskell, C/C++
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub Actions
- **Ethics in Application:** A core focus of my study has been identifying and proposing mitigations for technological harms on vulnerable members of society.

# üìê Project Experience

## üéì University

### Masters project - visual music editing with CQ spectrograms
* Demonstrated using advanced signal processing techniques to render an editable spectrogram of a song in an ordinary image format.
* Working with PyTorch for tensor operations.
* 76% mark (Honours Level)

### High performance metaheuristic algorithms using TensorFlow 
* Used TensorFlow to implement GPU accelerated particle swarm optimiser and genetic algorithms.

### [Edinburgh cycle share scheme](https://redd.it/mrbvvt) - data analysis and presentation 
* Analysed data from Edinburgh's cycle rental scheme during COVID-19 using Python data science packages

### [Binary Abacus](https://tommo.page/abacus) - Interactive binary learning tool for learners
* Built a modern, interactive web application using React to help learners interact with binary numbers in a more meaningful way.
* Implemented various encoding options and technical levels (unsigned/signed binary, IEEE 754, ASCII).
* Designed with responsive layout and multiple interaction modes (keyboard/mouse) for accessibility.

### [Workout Mate](https://workout.tommo.page) - Gymnastics strength and conditioning app 
* As part of a redesign project for the Hevy workout app, I developed a web app which now is used to provide the Edinburgh University Gymnastics club's strength and conditioning programme.
* Used React, Astro and Github Actions to create a web app to help the club members perform \\ workouts.

### Tenuto - Robot piano tutor 
* Developed hardware and control software for a robotic piano tutor concept, interfacing with Bluetooth LE MIDI and utilising wireless chips, microcontrollers, and high-power transistors to drive a solenoid array, with variable key velocity using PWM signalling.
* Key player in a large team; product demo rated best among 23 teams by technology and business experts.

## üéÆ Hobby projects

### SendEvent app - NLP assisted events and invitations 
* Uses a natural language processing framework to turn plain English descriptions of events into shareable formats.

### Wireless measurement device for understanding impact forces on gymnasts 
* Created a wearable harness with inertial measurement hardware, collected data over Bluetooth using Python API.
* Analysis and visualisation to gain insights into physical preparation.

<!-- ### [Training clock](https://clock.tommo.page) for Edinburgh university gymnastics club 
* Built using React and deployed using Firebase.
* Used for my former role as social and fundraising coordinator for the club.
* Synchronised to a central calendar and displays upcoming social/competitive events. -->

## üè´ High school

### Scottish Baccalaureate in STEM - wireless communication using visible light 
* Highest Baccalaureate grade for the Angus district (2019).
* Learned embedded programming, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications; developed a relay chat proof of concept in an independent research project.
