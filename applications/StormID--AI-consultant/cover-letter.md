Dear Storm ID hiring team,

I am writing to express interest in the Graduate AI Consultant position at Storm ID. As a student at Edinburgh University I was fortunate to build a strong foundation in computer science shortly before it became apparent that machine learning would take over the world. At the same time I developed a keen interest in driving civic benefit from technology, and in particular advances in machine learning.
I think it's fantastic that you are already delivering the promises of AI to the public sector through your work on the census, heritage and planning, and I'm impressed by your strong civil and ethical mandate.  I would love to be of help to your cause.

My academic background is in computer science, my undergrad focused on building the theory of computation from the atoms up. In my honours years, I worked extensively with ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and have developed independent experience applying large language models to business problems with a core focus on human centred design, including as a developer at [Inkwell PR](https://www.linkedin.com/company/inkwell-pr-technology/posts/?feedView=all) and a new venture QuickWord. With experience in community organisations, mentoring kids in computer science, and university projects, I hope I'm positioned well to connect a technical understanding of AI with empathy for clients.

What particularly draws me to Storm ID is the opportunity to work on projects that really would be an impactful use of what I have learned. I would be excited to gain a variety of professional experience, become a better communicator and work alongside experienced consultants. In particular I would love to have impact on the areas of democratic representation, planning and transportation. 

I welcome the opportunity to talk to you and look forward to discussing how I could fit in to Storm ID's mission. Thank you for considering my application today.

With regards,
Thomas Chung
