For the hiring manager,

By some accident and some deliberate action, I've had nearly a decade's experience in extremely varied community roles and employment. I've engaged with a diversity of people; from working with recent immigrants in factories, to training alongside world class athletes in university sport; I was immediately interested in becoming a Customer Service Field Agent at the Office for National Statistics.

I'm deeply interested in people, and my experience in diverse roles in mentoring, fundraising, festivals, and hospitality helped me build an ability to connect and engage with anyone. I also have strong data skills from my degree in computer science. Having dipped a toe in so many different circumstances, I value being open, listening and understanding above all.
Evidenced in my previous roles in customer service and public engagement, I can offer a positive representation of your office to the public and ensure survey participants are met with kindness and a high standard of professionalism.

I'm available to carry out the five month contract, with an active Scottish PVG/DBS from the National STEM Learning Centre for a children's coding club. I'm Edinburgh based, and have access to a car with a full UK driving license.

I look forward to working with you to serve the public and support the exemplary standard of data your office is renowned for.

Yours sincerely,

Thomas Chung
