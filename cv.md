# üìê Experience & Projects

## AI & Data Projects

### **Masters project - graphically editable music transformations**
- Implemented advanced signal processing and ML compatible mathematical transforms (NSGT) to demonstrate a novel music editing workflow with improved interpretability of the transformation process.
- Working with tensor computation in PyTorch for signal processing, focusing on making complex mathematical operations more transparent and controllable.

### **High performance metaheuristic algorithms using TensorFlow**
- Used TensorFlow to implement metaheuristic algorithms (particle swarm optimiser, genetic algorithm) leveraging CUDA, with structured internal representations for algorithm state tracking.

### **[Edinburgh cycle share scheme](https://redd.it/mrbvvt) - data analysis and presentation**
- Analysed and visualised public sector transport data using Python and data science packages, providing actionable insights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Developed comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarks for assessing data quality and model predictions.

### **Inkwell PR - GPT based press release generator**
- Contributed to the development of a GPT based press release generator, refining the core service and integrating payment/subscription.
- Focused on improving model interpretability and reasoning consistency through structured prompt engineering and output validation.

### **SendEvent app - NLP assisted events and invitations**
- Used NLP tools to turn plain English phrases into structured, shareable iCal files.
- Experimented with fine-tuning LLaMa, Qwen and Gemini models to perform advanced phrase NLU: "every second friday of june except 16th", evaluating model performance across multiple benchmarks and analyzing reasoning transparency.

## Web & Software Projects

### **[Binary Abacus](https://tommo.page/abacus) - Interactive binary learning tool for kids** 
- Built a modern, interactive web application using React to help users learn about binary numbers, encoding systems, and bitwise operations.
- Implemented features including multiple rows for simultaneous values, configurable bit columns, and various encoding options (unsigned/signed binary, IEEE 754, ASCII).
- Created an intuitive UI with visual beads that change color based on position, keyboard shortcuts, and sound feedback.
- Designed with responsive layout and multiple interaction modes (keyboard/mouse) for accessibility.

### **[Workout Mate](https://workout.tommo.page) - Gymnastics strength and conditioning app** 
- Developed a web app for the Edinburgh University Gymnastics club's strength and conditioning programme, using React, Astro, and GitHub Actions.
- Collaborated with club members to refine the app and deliver a user-focused solution.

## Hardware & Embedded Projects

### **Tenuto; Robot piano tutor** 
- Developed hardware and control software for a robotic piano tutor concept, interfacing with Bluetooth LE MIDI and utilising wireless chips, microcontrollers, and MOSFETs to drive a solenoid array, with variable key velocity using high-frequency control signals.
- Key player in a large team; product demo rated best among 23 teams by technology and business experts.

### **Wireless measurement device for understanding impact forces on gymnasts** 
- Created a wearable harness with inertial measurement hardware, collected data over Bluetooth using Python.
- Performed analysis and visualisation to gain insights into physical preparation.

### **[PlayerData](https://www.playerdata.com) - Full SoC emulation for driver code testing**
- Developed virtual driver testing for sports wearables using C/C++ on ARM chips.
- Learnt about realtime and low power systems.

### **Scottish Baccalaureate in STEM - wireless communication using visible light** 
- Self-taught in embedded programming, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications; developed a relay chat proof of concept as an independently organised project.
- Highest Baccalaureate grade for the Angus district (2019).
