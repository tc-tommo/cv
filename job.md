Title: Factored Representation for a Hybrid "Neuro-Symbolic" AI Model

 

Objective:  To explore the extent to which requiring a large language model (LLM) to explicitly structure its internal representation during reasoning impacts its performance and interpretability. 

 

Description

Large language models, based on the transformer architecture, are opaque. This results in a lack of trustworthiness when used for complex reasoning tasks. In this project, we are interested in making the internal reasoning process of such LLMs more interpretable and trustworthy. We explore the idea that forcing an LLM to maintain a structured internal state that expresses concepts and unknowns as symbols and variables respectively leads to comparable or better reasoning performance but with improved interpretability. You will assist in identifying suitable benchmarks/datasets, defining possible internal representations, and evaluating models.

 

Completion Criteria

A list of benchmarks for evaluation.
A fine-tuned model that uses an internal factored representation
A technical evaluation report.
Required Experience and Skills

Strong programming skills in Python.
Experience working with LLMs and an ability to fine-tune pre-trained open-source models.
Strong problem-solving abilities.
Good report writing skills.
